once upon a time...







thought this would be a fairytale story? Nope. Fairytales is literally the opposite of reality. in Reality, we won't have a pai of small feet, wearing a pair glass slipper, meet our fairygod mother, fall in love with a prince you just met, run away because the it's already 12 am in the morning, accidentally left one of the glass slippers one the staircase. Disney is just treaking us. Instead of wearing a pair of glass sliper, we get cut from it cause it will break like duh -.- In reality, you get judged everywhere for what ever you do. If you are pretty, they judge you. If you are ugly, they judge you. if you are dumb, they judge you. if you are smart, they judge you and so on. evantually, you'll get depressed and start having anxiety, cry to yourself but still tried to hide it beind a smile. this is realilty. you go to mcdonald's and you see Karens scolding the staff members for makng them wait for another 5 minutes just for their drinks, then people would not defend for the staff members but instead, video the whole situation and post it online, and viewers will start commenting on it, scoldng Karen and eventually even Karens fall into depression and starts avoiding everyone or even think about committing suicide, while people start talking about how dramatic they are and pour salt into their wound. this society lack of self conscious. when people starts ranting to their friends, their friends would start giving useless advise. what those people need is just a listening ear, because they are already clear of what they should do but ranting to their friends will end up being awkward to them and they will start avoiding them to. they would start questioning themselves such as "why am i still in this world?","why didn't anyone care?" ect. this is reality and it is very inTerEstINg.
